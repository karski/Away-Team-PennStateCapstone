# Away Team
Penn State Software Engineering Captsone project

Peter Karski  
Stephen Naimoli  
Clayton Parker  
David Vu  


## Overview
This project is the culmination of the Penn State Software Engineering Masters course.  The cohort was split into teams and each team was able to choose their own project and goals.  Team 3 set out to build a cross-platform tool to coordinate group travel with a focus on work travel.  The resulting Away Team project provides travelers with the ability to create teams that are public or private that can be used to share tasks, events, contact information, and location.  
This repository includes some of the documentation that was created to help explain the project more clearly.  
- For a quick introduction to the project, our [final presentation](Final%20Presentation.pptx) describes the project features with screenshots that depict some of the key functionality that was developed.
- The [class diagrams](Class%20Diagrams.pdf) depict the data schema as well as some of the state flow for the user interface design.
- The [requirements](Requirements%20Document.pdf) written by the team cover the goals set out for the project at the outset.  This document provides a good sense of the scope of the project in a concise format.
- For a detailed description of the development process and lessons learned, consult the team's [final report](Team%203%20Final%20Report.pdf).  This document also recaps the team's requirements and the level of success in covering the original goals.

## Responsibilities
Away Team was developed by Team 3, consisting of Peter Karski, Stephen Naimoli, Clayton Parker, and David Vu.  The entire team collaborated to decide upong the project goals, requirements, and overall system design.  Implementation of the project was split out amongst the team members:
- **Peter Karski:** Android Application
- **Stephen Naimoli:** Server and API
- **Clayton Parker:** Web page
